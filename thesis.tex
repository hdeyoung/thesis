\begin{abstract}
Concurrent systems are ubiquitous, but notoriously difficult to get right -- subtle races and deadlocks can lurk even in the most extensively tested of systems.
In a quest to tame concurrency, researchers have successfully applied the principle of computation as deduction to concurrency in two distinct ways: concurrency as proof reduction and concurrency as proof construction.
These two approaches to concurrency have complementary advantages, with the proof-construction approach excelling at global specification of a system's dynamics, while the proof-reduction approach is best suited to implementation of the system's components\fixnote{processes?}.

This document explores the relationship between these two different proof-theoretic characterizations of concurrency, in the particular context of concurrent systems that have chain topologies.
Along the way, we also uncover a \emph{semi-axiomatic sequent calculus} for singleton logic, which blends a standard sequent calculus with axiomatic aspects of Hilbert calculi;
and establish a correpondence between proof normalization and asychronous message-passing communication [among processes arranged in a chain].
