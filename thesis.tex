Concurrent systems are ubiquitous, but notoriously difficult to get right: subtle races and deadlocks can lurk even in the most extensively tested of systems.
In a quest to tame concurrency, researchers have successfully applied the principle of \emph{computation as deduction} to concurrency in two distinct ways: \emph{concurrency as proof reduction} and \emph{concurrency as proof construction}.
These two approaches to concurrency have complementary advantages, with the proof-construction approach excelling at global specification of a system's dynamics, while the proof-reduction approach is best suited to implementation of the processes that comprise the system.

This document explores the relationship between these two different proof-theoretic characterizations of concurrency.
To focus on the essential aspects of their relationship, the exploration is carried out in the context of concurrent systems that have chain topologies.
From a proof-construction perspective, chain topologies arise from ordered logic; from a proof-reduction perspective, they arise from \emph{singleton logic}, a variant of ordered logic that restricts sequents to have exactly one antecedent.

In this context, a rewriting framework is systematically derived from the ordered sequent calculus, and a \emph{message-passing} fragment of that rewriting framework is identified.
String rewriting specifications of concurrent systems can be \emph{choreographed} into this fragment, and the fragment supports a notion of bisimilarity.
Along the way, we also uncover a \emph{semi-axiomatic sequent calculus} for singleton logic, which blends a standard sequent calculus with axiomatic aspects of Hilbert systems, and we then establish a correspondence between semi-axiomatic proof normalization and asynchronous message-passing communication.
Ultimately, the message-passing processes can be faithfully embedded within the message-pass\-ing ordered rewriting framework in a bisimilar way.
Perhaps surprising is that, because the embedding is left-invertible, we can also identify fairly broad conditions under which local, process implementations can be \emph{extracted} from global, message-passing ordered rewriting specifications.
