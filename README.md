# Henry DeYoung's PhD thesis #

This repository houses the LaTeX source for my PhD thesis.
For the rare person that might be interested in cloning this
repository and compiling the LaTeX source to a PDF, I suggest:

    git clone https://github.com/hdeyoung/thesis.git
    pdflatex thesis.tex
    biblatex thesis.tex
    pdflatex thesis.tex
    pdflatex thesis.tex

Please contact me at `hdeyoung@cs.cmu.edu` if you have problems compiling.
