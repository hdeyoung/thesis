\chapter{Session-typed ordered rewriting}\label{ch:session-typed-rewriting}

\begin{itemize}
\item Reverse-engineer session typing rules for ordered specifications
\item The translation is invertible for well-typed ordered contexts
\item Typed bisimilarity is somehow equivalent to ordered bisimilarity, when contexts are typed\footnote{Different chapter?}
\item Type inference for ordered specifications\footnote{Different chapter?}
\end{itemize}
